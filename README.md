 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate Computer Science student at Graphic Era University with a strong foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Machine Learning. My goal is to apply my technical skills to contribute to innovative projects that create impactful solutions. I am always seeking opportunities for continuous learning and professional growth.






🌱 Constantly learning and expanding my knowledge in 

Machine Learning tools like TensorFlow and Keras.

👯 Eager to collaborate on innovative projects that leverage my 

problem-solving and critical-thinking skills.

⚡ Fun fact: I was a 

runner-up in the J.P. Morgan Code for Good 2025 national hackathon, where I was among the 231 selected from over 50,000 applicants!

🌟 Featured Projects
💻 CPU Scheduling Visualizer

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 


Description: I built an interactive online visualizer that simulates CPU scheduling algorithms. It features a Gantt chart and an input panel for real-time simulation and also includes a comparison feature to evaluate the performance of different algorithms.


✍️ Hindi Handwritten Character Recognition

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras 


Description: I designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten Hindi characters. The model was trained using the Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset (DHCD) and achieved a high 

97% accuracy on unseen characters.


📊 Sentiment Analysis of Student Reviews

Tech Stack: Python, NLP 


Description: I trained and evaluated two models, Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree, to analyze student review sentiments. The project involved using NLP techniques like tokenization and lemmatization. The Decision Tree model achieved a high accuracy of 


98%.
